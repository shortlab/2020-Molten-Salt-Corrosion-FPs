The corrosion microstructure of Hastelloy N was more varied than the other alloys tested in our study. 
In some samples, it appears that Mo-rich carbides were removed from the cross-sectioned surface during polishing. 

Also, some but not all Hastelloy N samples demonstrated some minor grain boundary attack. 

For the purposes of this study, we took the corrosion depth in Hastelloy N to be the uniformly attacked region of severe corrosion near the surface.
