This dataset includes SEM images, EDX linescan data, and EMPA data for the 4 alloys tested in our study: Hastelloy N, 316L Stainless Steel, Ni-201, and Incoloy 800H. 

Molten-Salt-Corrosion-Data.xlsx contains the maximum corrosion depth data reported in our paper. 

The SEM image corresponding to that corrosion depth is organized by directory as Material > Salt > Test Time. 

EDX linescans and EMPA data are also organized by material.
